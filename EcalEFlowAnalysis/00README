#### Compile the code ######
make all

#### Create list of ntuple files ##########
After having creted the ntuples with the PhiSymmetryCalibration program to create the splitted list of files to run on do

Example: ./runPrepareList.csh listRUN2011 /eos/cms/store/group/alca_ecalcalib/EFlow/AlCaPhiSym eos 1 

Modify the parameters according to your needs

if need to run on automatic produced ntuples add an additional paramater at the end = 1
./runPrepareList.csh listRUN2012_test /eos/cms/store/group/alca_ecalcalib/EFlow/AlCaPhiSym_Run2012A-v1_RAW_190456_190679_bTR eos 1 1  

##### Send createHistoryPlots jobs #######
Modify launchCreateJobs.sh variables at the top of the script according to your needs (interval file, output directory in xrootd, etc etc)
Example to launch it: ./launchCreateJobs.sh `pwd`/listRUN2011/filelist1*txt

It is important that list files are named like filelistXXXXXXXX.txt and the path to the files is absolute and not relative
